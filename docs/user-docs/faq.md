# FAQ

## Purchases
**Q: Can i share my bought resources from your marketplace?**

**A:** <em>No.</em> SyncEngine is fully funded through sales from our marketplace. This means we don’t rely on ads, data monetization, or external funding, ensuring our focus remains on delivering the best experience for you. Every purchase you make directly supports the development, maintenance, and growth of the project.

**Q: Newer versions of my purchases are not included?**

**A:** Sometimes! Module updates are handled by their individual developers, and their availability can vary. While some updates are included automatically, larger or more complex updates may require additional consideration or a separate purchase.
We recommend checking the module's update policy or contacting the developer for specific details. This ensures you stay informed about the latest features and improvements!

Thank you for being part of our journey and helping us stay independent!
