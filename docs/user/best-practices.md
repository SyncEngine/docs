### Why Use Modules?
* Easy to Install: Modules can be added with just a few clicks, allowing you to expand functionality without complex setups.
* Simplified Maintenance: Module developers handle updates, so you’ll automatically benefit from the latest improvements and bug fixes without manual intervention.
* Scalable Solutions: Use only the modules you need, keeping your system lightweight and tailored to your requirements.

## Perform Weekly Backups
Data integrity is critical, and regular backups ensure you’re protected against unexpected issues.
> Tip: If you don't want to manage your hosting and backups, use SyncEngine's managed hosting and we will do it for you!

## Backup Recommendations
* Automate Backups: Schedule weekly automated backups to minimize manual work and ensure consistency.
