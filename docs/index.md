## What is SyncEngine?

SyncEngine is an **open and extensible automation framework** built for developers and system integrators.  
It lets you connect multiple systems, define your own data flows, and run automations with precision and reliability.

Key highlights:

- **Powerful Flows** – Create advanced workflows with multiple routines and decision logic.
- **Reusable Routines** – Group common actions and reuse them across different flows.
- **Visual Dashboard** – Track every run and inspect detailed logs to understand exactly what’s happening.
- **Dry-Run & Preview** – Test safely before deploying to production.
- **Expandable by Design** – Add your own connections, tasks, and modules to extend SyncEngine infinitely.

## Why SyncEngine?

SyncEngine was built with **flexibility**, **transparency**, and **freedom** at its core.

It is an **open-source project**, meaning you can install and host SyncEngine entirely on your own server — giving you full ownership and control over your data.  
No third party ever sees your information. Your automations, logs, and data remain 100% private and secure.

The **core of SyncEngine is free to use**, and everyone is encouraged to build and share their own modules to extend its functionality.  
Whether you need a custom connector, a new task type, or a business-specific workflow — you can develop it yourself or use what the community has created.

Every automation you build can be monitored, tested, and adjusted in real time.  
Whether you’re a small team automating a few tasks or a large organization integrating complex systems, SyncEngine scales with you.
